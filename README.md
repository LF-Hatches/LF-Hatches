- 👋 Hi, I’m @LF-Hatches 
- 👀 I picked this name because I came here to figure out how to make a custom hatch pattern in Revit.
- 🌱 Now, I'm down a rabbit-hole trying to customize PyRevit solutions for myself, in support of others
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making tools to streamline workflow.
- 📫 How to reach me ... lizmaeder gmail

- Googled "what is a github" not too long ago. Doesn't mean that I don't know things.. just that i'm super new here.
